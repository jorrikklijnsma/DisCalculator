2. Time as Text View:
   - When the "Time as Text" view is selected:
     - The app renders the `Time` component.
     - Functionality: The `Time` component likely displays or performs operations related to time in a textual format.

3. Text as Time View:
   - When the "Text as Time" view is selected:
     - The app renders the `TimeInText` component.
     - Functionality: The `TimeInText` component likely allows users to input text representing time and converts it to a structured time format or performs related time-related operations.

4. Header and Navigation:
   - The app includes a header section with a logo and a navigation menu.
   - Functionality:
     - Logo Display: The header displays a logo with the text "disCALCULATOR".

These are the features and functionalities provided by the given code. The app allows users to select a time interval and an hour value, calculates the early and late times based on the selections, and displays them along with the moments of the day. Additionally, it includes a clock component for visual representation of the selected time.

## Clock.svelte:
The provided code appears to be a snippet of a Svelte component that represents a clock with hour and minute hands. Here's a breakdown of its functional overview:

1. Exported Variables:
   - The component exports two variables: `hours` and `minutes`, which are of type `number`. These variables can be used to control the position of the clock hands.

2. Clock Display:
   - The component includes HTML markup that represents the clock.
   - Inside the clock, there are two `<span>` elements representing the minute hand and hour hand.
   - The rotation of each hand is controlled using CSS variables (`--rotate`) that depend on the `minutes` and `hours` values.

3. Styling:
   - The component includes scoped CSS styles using the SCSS syntax.
   - The `.clock` class represents the outer container of the clock.
   - The `.hourHand` and `.minuteHand` classes define the styles for the hour and minute hands, respectively.
   - The `--rotate` CSS variable is used to rotate the hands based on the calculated values of `minutes` and `hours`.

Overall, this code represents a clock component that can be used in a Svelte application. The exported variables `hours` and `minutes` control the position of the clock hands, and the CSS styles define the appearance of the clock and its hands.

## data.js: 
The provided code represents a JSON-like data structure in JavaScript, containing various mappings and arrays related to time conversion. Here's a breakdown of each section:

1. `hourConvert`: This object maps numeric hour values (0-24) to their corresponding textual representation in Dutch. For example, `0` is mapped to `'twaalf'`, `1` is mapped to `'één'`, and so on.

2. `minuteConvert`: This object maps numeric minute values (0-59) to their corresponding textual representation in Dutch. For example, `0` is mapped to `'nul'`, `1` is mapped to `'één'`, `2` is mapped to `'twee'`, and so on.

3. `quarters`: This array contains objects representing different quarter-hour intervals. Each object has two properties: `text` (the textual representation in Dutch) and `value` (the corresponding minute value). For example, the first object represents a "heel uur" (full hour) with a value of `0`, the second object represents "kwart over" (a quarter past the hour) with a value of `15`, and so on.

4. `interval5Minutes`: This array contains objects representing 5-minute intervals. Each object has two properties: `text` (the textual representation in Dutch) and `value` (the corresponding minute value). For example, the first object represents "5 over" with a value of `5`, the second object represents "10 over" with a value of `10`, and so on.

5. `intervalCombined`: This array combines the quarter-hour intervals and the 5-minute intervals into a single array. It includes additional objects with the `nextHour` property set to `true`, indicating that the interval spans across the next hour. For example, the fifth object represents "10 voor half" (10 minutes before the half-hour) with a value of `20` and `nextHour` set to `true`.

6. `hours`: This array represents the 12-hour format in Dutch. Each object contains the textual representation of an hour and its corresponding numeric value. For example, the first object represents `'één'` (one) with a value of `1`, the second object represents `'twee'` (two) with a value of `2`, and so on.

Overall, this data structure provides mappings and representations for hours, minutes, intervals, and quarter-hour divisions in Dutch. It can be used to convert numeric time values into their corresponding textual representations for various use cases, such as displaying time in a localized format or generating text-to-speech output.
