Based on the functionality we've analyzed in Step 1, the app structure could look like this:

1. **Main Screen** (App.svelte): This is the first screen users see when they open the app. It includes a header with a logo and navigation links to switch between the two views: "Time as Text" and "Text as Time". The selected view will be rendered on this screen. 

2. **Time as Text View** (Time.svelte): This view allows users to select a specific time and generates textual representations of that time. This includes an input for the hour and minute, a display of time in different formats, and a visual clock representation of the chosen time.

3. **Text as Time View** (TimeInText.svelte): In this view, users select a time interval and an hour value. The app calculates early and late times based on these selections and displays them with the moment of the day. This view also includes a visual clock representation of the selected time.

4. **Clock Component** (Clock.svelte): This is a reusable component that represents a clock with hour and minute hands. It is included in both the "Time as Text" and "Text as Time" views.

5. **Data Layer** (data.js): This is not a screen but an integral part of the app structure. It provides mappings and representations for hours, minutes, and intervals in Dutch. This data structure is likely used by the "Time as Text" and "Text as Time" views to convert numeric time values into textual representations.

In the context of an iOS app, you would have corresponding Swift files for each of these components. The "Main Screen" could be a `UIViewController` that embeds two different child view controllers ("Time as Text View" and "Text as Time View") based on the selected view. The "Clock Component" could be a custom UIView subclass that is used in both of the view controllers. The "Data Layer" could be represented as a Swift struct or class providing static data.
